# CoVid-GEO
Covid Statistics in Georgia from past 6 months.

# About this project
Hello. I am Bachi Mosulishvili and this is my one of the first projects in Python.
This project is about CoVid outbreak in Georgia. I used VacCovid tracker API to request data and I projected data in code output. 
I also made SQLite3 Database and put all the data in it. I don't know what to write in readme anymore :D
Thank you for your attention and wish you good health.
